# GISTS

Aggregation repository for all my github gists.

## Adding New Gist

1. Create gist in [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/)

2. Find gist URL. Example: `git@gist.github.com:98eb3e0caf7304e15ac9c6d65c1e9f4c.git`

3. Add as submodule to this repo:
    ```sh
    git submodule add [Gist URL] [Some directory name easy to remember]
    ```

4. Commit and push to aggregation repository. 

## Clone All Gists

1. Clone all submoduels using: `git clone --recurse-submodules [Repo URL]`

2. Note: If you have a lot of gists, there will be a lot of cloning.
